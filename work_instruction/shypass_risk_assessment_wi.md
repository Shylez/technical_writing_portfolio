# Work Instruction - Risk Assessment for Shypass Password Management Application

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this work instruction is to guide the structured execution and documentation of a security risk assessment for **Shypass**, a password management application. It operates as part of a broader **system of systems** which includes mobile clients, web interfaces, backend APIs, cloud infrastructure, and third-party integrations. The risk assessment follows a **Zero Trust** security philosophy: no user, device, or service is trusted by default. This instruction ensures threats, vulnerabilities, and business impacts are systematically identified, assessed, and mitigated to protect user data, ensure regulatory compliance, and maintain a strong security posture across Shypass's digital ecosystem.

---

## Scope

This instruction applies to all functional components of the Shypass platform—client applications, backend services, and integrations—covering both technical and organizational aspects of the risk landscape.

## Work Steps

### 1. Define Context  
The risk assessment begins with defining the context of the Shypass application. This includes identifying critical information assets such as encrypted password vaults, user credentials, access logs, and API keys. It is essential to establish the system boundaries covering all relevant components such as mobile and web interfaces, backend services, cloud infrastructure, and any third-party service integrations. Stakeholders involved, including development, security, compliance teams, and end users, must be clearly identified to ensure alignment and accountability throughout the process.

### 2. Identify Threats  
Threat identification involves analyzing the application using established frameworks such as STRIDE and OWASP Top 10. The assessment team, in collaboration with developers and security engineers, will conduct structured threat modeling sessions using system architecture diagrams and data flow diagrams (DFDs). This process helps visualize possible attack vectors and threat agents, such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, brute-force login attempts, or abuse of forgotten password workflows. Cross-functional brainstorming ensures a comprehensive view of technical and social threats.

### 3. Identify Vulnerabilities  
The next step is to uncover vulnerabilities within the application and its environment. This is achieved through SOUP Tool (an internal tool) and manual code or configuration reviews. Vulnerabilities may include insecure data transmission, improper session handling, or outdated dependencies. Each identified weakness is mapped to the threats it may enable, allowing for a structured and traceable vulnerability inventory.

### 4. Assess Risk  
Once threats and vulnerabilities are mapped, each risk is evaluated based on two dimensions: likelihood of occurrence and potential impact. These are rated on a standard 5-point scale. Using this information, risks are categorized via a risk matrix to classify them as Low, Medium, High, or Critical. This process includes qualitative and quantitative assessments and considers potential business impact such as user data exposure, regulatory non-compliance, or loss of customer trust.

### 5. Recommend Controls  
After assessing the risks, the team recommends mitigating controls to reduce or eliminate them. These may include implementing end-to-end encryption, enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA), adding anomaly detection, or tightening access controls using role-based access control (RBAC). The selection of controls should align with recognized standards such as ISO 27001, CIS Controls, and OWASP ASVS. Each control must have a clearly assigned owner responsible for implementation and ongoing monitoring.

### 6. Document Findings (Technical Writer’s Key Involvement)  
At this stage, the technical writer plays a critical role in compiling and structuring the findings into a formal Risk Assessment Report. Working closely with the risk analyst and security engineer, the writer gathers supporting evidence for each identified risk and mitigation, drafts an executive summary, outlines the assessment methodology, and presents the results in a structured, audit-friendly format. The language used must be accessible to both technical and non-technical readers. Additionally, the report should include visual elements such as risk heatmaps, timelines, and system diagrams. Drafts should be maintained in a version-controlled format like Word, Markdown, or a documentation platform such as Confluence.

### 7. Review & Approve  
The final step involves sharing the draft report with relevant stakeholders for review. Feedback is incorporated and the report is finalized for approval. Once approved, the report may be submitted to internal leadership, compliance teams, or external auditors. Any recommended mitigation actions are tracked for implementation, and responsibilities are assigned with timelines to ensure follow-through.

## Conclusion

Conducting a structured risk assessment for Shypass not only ensures the security and trustworthiness of the application but also reinforces its resilience in a zero-trust, interconnected ecosystem. By identifying and mitigating risks proactively, the Shypass team supports secure credential management and upholds compliance, user trust, and business continuity.
