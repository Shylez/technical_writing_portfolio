# Work Instruction - Risk Assessment for Shypass Password Management Application

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this work instruction is to guide the structured execution and documentation of a security risk assessment for **Shypass**, a password management application. It operates as part of a broader **system of systems** which includes mobile clients, web interfaces, backend APIs, cloud infrastructure, and third-party integrations. The risk assessment follows a **Zero Trust** security framework which mandates no user, device, or service is trusted by default.

---

## Scope

This instruction applies to all functional components of the Shypass platform—client applications, backend services, and integrations—covering both technical and organizational aspects of the risk landscape.

## Work Steps

### 1. Define Context  
The risk assessment begins with defining the context of the Shypass application. This includes identifying critical information assets such as encrypted password vaults, user credentials, access logs, and API keys. It is essential to establish the system boundaries covering all relevant components such as mobile and web interfaces, backend services, cloud infrastructure, and any third-party service integrations. Stakeholders involved, including development, security, compliance teams, and end users, must be clearly identified to ensure alignment and accountability throughout the process.

### 2. Identify Threats  
Threat identification for Shypass is performed using the STRIDE threat modeling methodology, which focuses on six key threat categories. The assessment team, in collaboration with developers and security engineers, systematically evaluates each part of the Shypass ecosystem, such as user authentication flows, encrypted vaults, APIs, and backend services—against each STRIDE category. Architecture diagrams and data flow diagrams (DFDs) are used to visualize trust boundaries and data movement, helping uncover logical and technical threats.

The STRIDE categories are applied as follows:

 - **Spoofing**: Threats where attackers attempt to impersonate legitimate users or systems. For Shypass, this could include brute-force attacks or credential stuffing to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

- **Tampering**: Refers to unauthorized modifications of data or code. An attacker might attempt to alter encrypted vault contents or tamper with session tokens in transit.

- **Repudiation**: Involves scenarios where a user denies performing an action without proper audit trails. For Shypass, insufficient logging might allow a malicious actor to deny access attempts or vault changes.

- **Information Disclosure**: Threats that involve exposing sensitive data. Examples include data leaks due to misconfigured storage, unencrypted communications, or verbose error messages revealing internal logic.

- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Situations where the system is made unavailable to legitimate users. Attackers might overwhelm authentication services, API endpoints, or key management services to disrupt password retrieval.

- **Elevation of Privilege**: When a user or attacker gains higher access rights than intended. In Shypass, this could involve exploiting backend flaws to access administrative functions or decrypt other users’ vaults.

By categorizing threats in this structured way, STRIDE ensures a comprehensive analysis of potential attack vectors across the entire Shypass system.

### 3. Identify Vulnerabilities  
The next step is to uncover vulnerabilities within the application and its environment. This is achieved through SOUP Tool, Shypass’s internal scanning and analysis platform. SOUP Tool performs comprehensive security checks across the application codebase, configurations, dependencies, and deployment pipelines. It detects issues such as insecure API endpoints, weak cryptographic practices, outdated libraries, hardcoded secrets, and misconfigured permissions.. Each identified weakness is mapped to the threats it may enable, allowing for a structured and traceable vulnerability inventory.

### 4. Assess Risk  
Once threats and vulnerabilities are mapped, each risk is evaluated based on two dimensions: likelihood of occurrence and potential impact. These are rated on a standard 5-point scale. Using this information, risks are categorized via a risk matrix to classify them as Low, Medium, High, or Critical. This process includes qualitative and quantitative assessments and considers potential business impact such as user data exposure, regulatory non-compliance, or loss of customer trust.

### 5. Recommend Controls  
After assessing the risks, the team recommends mitigating controls to reduce or eliminate them. These may include implementing end-to-end encryption, enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA), adding anomaly detection, or tightening access controls using role-based access control (RBAC). The selection of controls should align with recognized standards. Each control must have a clearly assigned owner responsible for implementation and ongoing monitoring.

### 6. Document Findings 
At this stage, the technical writer compile and structure the findings into a formal Risk Assessment Report. Working closely with the risk analyst and security engineer, the writer gathers supporting evidence for each identified risk and mitigation, drafts an executive summary, outlines the assessment methodology, and presents the results in a structured, audit-friendly format. The language used must be accessible to both technical and non-technical readers. Additionally, the report should include visual elements such as risk heatmaps, timelines, and system diagrams. Drafts should be maintained in Confluence.

### 7. Review & Approve  
The final step involves sharing the draft report with relevant stakeholders for review. Feedback is incorporated and the report is finalized for approval. Once approved, the report may be submitted to internal leadership, compliance teams, or external auditors. Any recommended mitigation actions are tracked for implementation, and responsibilities are assigned with timelines to ensure follow-through. After a consensus is reached among all the key stakeholders, the finalized report is submitted into **Agile PLM** by the Technical Writer.

## Conclusion

Conducting a structured risk assessment for Shypass not only ensures the security and trustworthiness of the application but also reinforces its resilience in a zero-trust, interconnected ecosystem. By identifying and mitigating risks proactively, the Shypass team supports secure credential management and upholds compliance, user trust, and business continuity.
